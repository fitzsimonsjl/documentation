# How to retrieve your consent from Cookie Information as a website visitor

_This article will walk you through what you need to get in order to request a record of your consent from Cookie Information_

In order to request a record of your consent from us for a particular website, you will need to find your user_uid property. This is a random ID assigned to your consent that can be used to find it later on should you wish to view it.

This uid_property is not tied to any personal information, and we do not store any personal information about you when running our services. If you would like to see examples of what information we do collect, please see our article Do I need to sign a data-processing agreement with Cookie Information?

Finding your user_uid property is fairly simple (we will use Cookie Information as an example):

Under the Storage menu, expand the Cookies item and click on the main domain. Find the CookieInformationConsent cookie and click on it.

At the bottom of the window you sould see a string of text with items relating to your consent, a website uid, the website address and so on. Locate the user_uid property and make a note of it.

With this user_uid, you can now get in touch with us at support@cookinformation.com and let us know you'd like to see a record of your consent.
